CHAPTER 5
Secure Your Services

Secure Services in Three Steps
Security in distributed services can be broken down into three steps:
1. Encrypt data in-flight to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks;
2. Authenticate to identify clients; and
3. Authorize to determine the permissions of the identified clients.


Encrypt In-Flight Data

The process by which a client and server communicate is
kicked off(начинают) by a TLS
handshake. During this handshake, the client and server:

1. Specify which version of TLS they’ll use;
2. Decide which cipher suites (the set of
   encryption algorithms) they’ll use;

3. Authenticate the identity of the server via the server’s
   private key and the certificate authority’s digital
   signature; and

4. Generate session keys for symmetric encryption
 after the handshake is complete.

 Once this handshake process is complete, the client
  and server can communicate securely.

Authenticate to Identify Clients
