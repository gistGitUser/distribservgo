Server-to-Server Service Discovery

Service discovery is one of the coolest
things about distributed services: machines automatically
discovering other machines!

Why Use Service Discovery?

Service discovery is the process of figuring out how
to connect to a service. A service discovery solution must
keep an up-to-date list (also known as a registry) of services,
their locations, and their health. Downstream services
then query this registry to discover the location of upstream
services and connect to themâ€”for example, a web service
discovering and connecting to its database. This way, even if
the upstream services change (scale up or down, or get replaced),
downstream services can still connect to them.
